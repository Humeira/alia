## Instructions for Running Locally

Clone to your computer using:

`git clone https://github.com/rmorabia/alia.git`

Then, open `index.html` to access the site.

## Special Thanks

The [TMDb API](http://developers.themoviedb.org) is extremely open and well-documented. Without their liberal use policy, this wouldn't have been possible.

In order to make the YouTube trailer responsive, I borrowed code from [this article](https://avexdesigns.com/responsive-youtube-embed/).
